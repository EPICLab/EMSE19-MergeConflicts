Developers maintain \textit{awareness}~(1) of conflicts within the codebase in different ways. Once aware, developers \textit{plan}~(2) a solution to fix the conflict. And finally, developers \textit{evaluate}~(3) the effectiveness of their deployed resolutions.}

\boldif{Results from interviews indicated that a common model of operating with merge conflicts exists.}

\boldif{\textit{Add anecdotal quotes and descriptions from interviews to highlight these observations.}}

\boldif{Based on these anecdotal observations, we construct an initial model of the processes that developers employ when working with merge conflicts, see Fig.~\ref{model}.}
Based on the initial anecdotal observations obtained from the interviews, we constructed an initial model of the process developers use when working with merge conflcits.
Figure~\ref{model} shows the model.
It consists of 3 phases: \emph{awareness, planning,} and \emph{resolution}

\boldif{Awareness is how developers become aware}
The \emph{awareness} phase consists of the actions developers take to become aware of the merge conflicts.
This could be accidental, or passive, as the developer will become of a merge conflict when they try to merge changes, or when they perform a pull.
At the other end of the spectrum are developers who are \emph{proactively} monitoring for merge conflicts as they code.
They are looking for changes that might be problematic, either manually (regular updates) or through the use of specialized tools.

\boldif{Planning is when developers plan their future actions}
The second phase \emph{planning} occurs after the developer has become aware that a conflict has occurred, and they are about to tackle the conflict.
Some developers might try and solve it immediately, while others might postpone the resolution.
Some might change their strategy depending on the conflict, incoming deadlines, etc.

\boldif{Evaluation is how developers check that their solution is correct}
Finally, after the conflict has been resolved, developers enter in their \emph{evaluation} phase.
In this phase, the developer has to evaluate their resolution before it is committed to the repository. 
This is to ensure the correctness of the resultant code.
Possible actions during this stage are compilation and building the product at one end.
Developer wanting more guarantees can go a step further and run the tests.
Finally, some groups might have policies such as code reviews that need to be performed on the merge conflict resolution.
 
\boldif{To explore and validate this model, we asked developers to reflect upon how they become aware of merge conflicts, how they plan for merge conflict resolutions, and how they evaluate their merge conflict resolutions in the \textit{Processes Survey}~(S1).}
In order to explore and validate this model, and our assumption, we conducted the \emph{Processes Survery}~(S1).
We plan on understanding how developers become aware of a merge conflicts (what steps they take, what tools they use, etc.)
We also want to investigate their strategies for dealing with merge conflicts and how they decide when the resolution is emph{good.}

\boldif{We present the results to these research questions in Section~\ref{RQ1a}, \ref{RQ1b}, and \ref{RQ1c}.}
Sections~\ref{RQ1a}, \ref{RQ1b}, and \ref{RQ1c} presents the results to these research questions.

To understand the processes that software developers employ to maintain awareness of the state of code, we asked Processes Survey (S1) participants to categorize and describe their monitoring processes: whether and how they monitor for merge conflicts, and how they determine the urgency of any merge conflicts that occur.

We found that 32.26\% of participants do not monitor for merge conflicts during their development sessions.
For the 67.74\% participants that indicate \textit{yes} or \textit{sometimes} to the question of monitoring for merge conflicts, we asked them to describe the processes and tools that they use for monitoring.

We identified 61 different tools from the 126 responses.
Some mentioned generic responses such as \textit{``email''}, for which we create a separate category.
Table~\ref{s1_toolset} lists the top 10 most common tools used by participants to monitor for merge conflicts.

In examining the list of these tools, we note that developers most often use version control systems (e.g. Git, SVN, TFS, and unspecified VCS) to handle tracking changes, and potentially identifying merge conflicts, within a codebase.
In this list, there is also one continuous integration (CI) platform (Jenkins), an IT incident response platform (PagerDuty), and two VCS-hosting websites (GitHub and GitLab).
This indicates that developers are currently relying on reactive tools that indicate the presence of merge conflicts after they have been introduced to a codebase.

We then evaluated responses based on whether described processes were proactive or reactive in nature (using card sorting and negotiated agreement).
We find that 42 of 57 responses (73.68\%) described reactive processes for monitoring for merge conflicts.
Combined with the tools used, we find that developers are currently not leveraging the functionalities provided by many research prototypes (e.g., Palantir~\cite{palantir}, Crystal~\cite{Brun2011}) that are specifically designed to facilitate proactive conflict detection.

In addition, we identified \textbf{X} distinct categories of processes that developers use to monitor for merge conflicts (see Table~\ref{s1_monitoring_processes}).
 \textit{Provide further discussion on the results; analysis between Caius and Nick still needed to group the processes in groups}
