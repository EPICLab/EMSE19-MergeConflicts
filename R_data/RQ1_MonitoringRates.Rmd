title: "Programming Experience vs. Monitoring for Merge Conflicts"

Converting programming experience from ranges to nominal values, and inputing the percentage of participant responses that indicated ``Sometimes`` or ``Yes`` to the Processes Survey question ``Do you monitor for merge conflicts?``, we get the following dataframe:

```{r}
exp <- c("1-5 years", "6-10 years", "11-15 years", "16-20 years", "21-25 years", "26+ years")
exp_nom <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
monitoring <- c(63.6,70.4,76.5,58.3,75.0,0.0)
proactive <- c(76.2,57.9,61.5,71.4,66.7,0.0)
reactive <- c(23.8,42.1,38.5,28.6,33.3,0.0)
df <- data.frame(exp, exp_nom, monitoring, proactive, reactive)
```

Now we can analyze the correlation between ``exp_nom`` (as a numerical proxy for experience range) and ``mon`` using a Pearson correlation/covariance test:

```{r}
cor.test(df$exp_nom,df$monitoring)
cor.test(df$exp_nom,df$proactive)
cor.test(df$exp_nom,df$reactive)
```
