\section{Results}\label{results}

Results are categorized according to the life-cycle of merge conflicts; with specific results for the \textit{awareness} (Section~\ref{RQ1a}), \textit{planning} (Section~\ref{RQ1b}), and \textit{evaluation} phases (Section~\ref{RQ1c}).
We then present the difficulties that developers experience when managing merge conflicts (Section~\ref{RQ2}).
And finally, we examine the gaps in tool support for managing merge conflicts according to developer's needs (Section~\ref{RQ3}).
